### :woman_technologist: &nbsp;About Me :

I am a Full Stack Developer <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> from Nicaragua ðŸŒ‹.

How to turn what it seems to be impossible on your project into nice, clean, and functional code by hiring Deyvid Arauz the heroic soldier and biggest commander and front man of the new wave of Top-Quality developers of Latin America.

Dear potential client and future business associate, I would appreciate a couple of minutes of your time and attention to accompany me with the reading of these lines in a small journey through my professional profile, goals, aspirations, personal standards and characteristics that represent me as scholar and lover of the universe of web development, in order to help you get to know me as an engineer and developer, this being a selection tool with which you can make the best decision for your project to be successful through my services and added values to your assignment.

Whenever I start a new assignment or project, I first focus on knowing its objective, the scope it will have, the requirements that the client has, with these ideas already clear, I begin the work of transforming the client's abstract ideas into a most viable conception for development without abandoning the essence of the client's idea and pursuing as the main goal the purpose that the owner of the project wants to obtain, always taking care of the profitability of the assignment. Once the coding
plan is clear, I design a project planning route so that the work carried out has a successive and understandable order for anyone, with or without knowledge of web development or previous experience in the field. Time management to meet expectations and deliveries with a deadline is of the utmost importance to maintainthe expected international standards, which is why I always make a task execution plan, dividing them into priorities adjusted to the different requested delivery dates. by clients, in addition to dividing the tasks into small subtasks that allow me to have a visual of more organized progress.

If it is necessary in some very particular aspect of the needs of our clients, I have no problem with creating the code from scratch and totally customized to the client's needs.

Clients can expect from me the complete execution of their primary ideas, the ability to take an abstract idea and turn it into a reality, flashes of idea owners' mental insights into marketable functionality. United with the common thread of a formal, polite, respectful, constant, and continuous relationship to be aware of the changing needs of our clients, I believe that constant communication with the client
and with all the members of the team are key to success in customer management and is key to maintaining business relationships.
